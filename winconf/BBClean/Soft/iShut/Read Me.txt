iShut has 5 different modes; Shutdown, Logoff, Restart, Sleep, and All.
The default mode is All but you can change it but changing the argument in a shortcut or through your dock.

The arguments are;

-s  <=Shutdown
-l  <=Logoff
-r  <=Reboot
-h  <=Sleep\Hibernate

An example for a shortcut to Logoff mode when you run iShut is "C:\iShut\iShut.exe" -l
